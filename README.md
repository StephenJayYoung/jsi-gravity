# Gravity Challenge

Use [known formulas][formulas] to implement a function that calculates how
long it will take an object to fall from a given distance. For instance:

```javascript
var time = fallingTime(20);
```

You can also use [Wolfram Alpha][10meters] to check that you're calculating
the right value.
